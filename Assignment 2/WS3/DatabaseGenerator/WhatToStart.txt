Task 1:

If you’ve done it right, spinning up the:
	- Data tier --- RemotingServer project
	- then Business tier --- Business Tier project
	- then GUI --- WPF App 

will allow the program to run nicely.

If you **don’t** start the Business tier, the GUI should consequentially not be able to work.
